<h4 id="why-this-blog-exists">Why this blog exists</h4>
<p>This website is dedicated to documenting those aforementioned interests and sharing them on the internet ðŸ˜„. My objective is to compile the resources I have used and knowledge I have learned throughout the years onto a quick and convient place to access. Just doing my little part since as time brings change information can be lost to the past. Information on the web can be lost from changes to search engine algothrims, posts and/or comments being deleted, platforms updating content, developers retiring, repos being deleted/privated, and/or unmaintained servers and/or repos going offline.</p>
<p>The internet is a powerful tool. It is at it&rsquo;s best when it is used for communicating and sharing ideas and explantions that often would otherwise be lost, due from lack of such a global and easily accesable network of communication.</p>
<h4 id="how-i-started-and-why">How I started and why</h4>
<p>I have been doing web dev(web developement) since mid 2020. Started because some projects I was intrested and dev groups I was apart of lacked documentation on the web and lacked a internet presence.</p>
<p>I have been learning and doing cybersecurity and digital forsenics when I first started out with the AFA&rsquo;s Cyber Patriot in mid 2014.</p>
<p>I have been invested in improving my digital privacy since late 2016, and took it significantly more seriously in mid 2018 post Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal.</p>
<p>I have being experimenting on and with open source projects seriously since early 2017.</p>
<p>I have been testing and using various Android ROMs and apps on my devices since mid 2017.</p>
<h4 id="contact-me">Contact me</h4>
<p>I am available for interviews for employment opportunities, if you find my writings worthwhile ðŸ¤™. Information technology(IT) or Information systems(IS) are the specfic career fields that catch my interest. My contact email is <a href="mailto:ahlayer8tech.vcaco@aleeas.com">hidden, click on this hyperlink for email address</a>.</p>
